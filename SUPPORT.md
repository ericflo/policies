# Support

We would like to remind our users that Tracky is an open-source project, provided "as-is" without any official support. As a community-driven tool, we encourage users to rely on each other and contribute to the project by sharing knowledge, experiences, and solutions to issues that may arise. This means that, unfortunately, we do not offer direct support for the app.

However, we believe in the power of the community and its ability to help each other grow and improve the tool. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to discuss them on the [Tracky GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shopify/tracky). By doing so, you will not only be helping yourself but also contributing to the development of Tracky, making it better for everyone. Remember, your input is valuable and could potentially lead to the implementation of new features or enhancements that benefit the entire community.
